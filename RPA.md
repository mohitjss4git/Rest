# RPA
This is to contain RPA notes

## Introduction
- Enterprise grade
- To replace repetitive tasks ( Follows a series of instruction)
- Fast work
- Easy to integrate with other systems
- Navigate diferent digital landscapes
- Built for complexity
- Non invasive
- Scalable

### Benifits
- Decreased cycle time and through put.
- Flexibility and scalability
- Imporoved Accuracy(No spell mistakes)
- Improved employee moral
- Detailed data capture ( can be monitored and audited)

### Digital Workforce

- scalability
- better adjustment
- 

## Buisness Case 

### Checklist

- Rule based process
- Digital trigger to initiate process with digital data
- Functioning and stable process
- high volume process

### Industry Use Case

  - data validation
  - report creation
  - data migration between banking application and cutomer account management
- IT
  - H/w & S/w Testing 
- Manufacturing 
  - logistics data 
-TeleCommunication
  - collecting and consolidating data from client ph system
  - backing up informatio
- Government Sector
  - validating sub contract data
  - integrating legacy 
- Medical Sector
  - claim status and eligibility

  - email 


## Introduction to Automation Anywhere 

### What is Automation Anywhere 

- infrasturcuture agnostic( desktop to datacenter - can be centrally deployed)
- Enterprise grade
- Creates Digital workforce with ease(Flexibility, speed, scale)
- Can be used to automate any app ( user interface, API, OS, DB)

## Automation Anywhere Enterprise Platform
- Object based recorder
- Screen Recorder
- Web Recorder
- 575 drag and drop commands to automate buisness process
- Centralize control room (Army of development and runtime clients)

- Automate
  - Transform a complex process into a single mouse click
  - create automation tasks in minute
  - Automate FTP/SFTP process
- Manage(Centralize control, distribution and analysis)
  - Run scheduled task when computer is locked ( Bot scheduling)
  - Manage automated process
  - manage automation users with a scalable server
  - maintain centralized servers for backup, security and resources
- Define(Visually document any process with click of a button)
  - Automate scripts that exist in disparate format
  - Capture and reuse automated process in a central repository
  - Schedule and execute batch data processing with ease
  
  
  ## How does it work (Automation Anywhere Enterprise Platform Architecture )
  
  ### Hub and Spoke Architecture 
  
 - Control Room( creator and runner are autorized and managed by control room)
 - Bot Creators(Development Client, Bot developer client system)
 - Bot Runners(Run time client, sits on desktop, on premise, cloud infra)
 
 #### Control Room (Web Based) Overview
 
 - interactive dashboard (whats active and whats scheduled)
 - Repository Manager(shows number of active bots by demarcation of file types(doc, xls), bots can be pushed to clients)
 - Operation Room (real time monitoring running and scheduled bots for bot runners, manual distribution at high load time, 
 - User Management (role based access control)
 - Audit Trial (activity and time stamp)
 - Task Schedules( used to crate schedule for a specific bot for a specific client(can be grouped)
 - License Management (inventroy control and s/f license, central point of admistration of creators and runners)



### Bot Creator ( Bot development client)

- licensed for each type of bot and comes with a runtime
- Runs on windows and must be registered with active control room to work
- can edit the properties of a bot like scheduling

 ### Bot Runners ( Bot development client) 
 
 - Can only work once they are authenticated
 - windows 
 - cached locally and shared with contol center
 
 ## Sense AI Technology
 
 - cognitive capable 
 - Analytics
 - Private key/public key
 - SAML 2.0 integrated
 - support for LDAP/AD
 
 ## AUTOMATION ANYWHERE ENTERPRISE ADVANCED FEATURES
 
 ### Automation Anywhere Bots
 
 #### Task Bots
 - Responsible for base creation for AA 
 - completing rule based tasks
 - Easir to build and resitant to change
 
 #### IQ Bots (with vision skills)
 
 - Next gen intelligent bots
 - have cognitive capabilties 
 - extract information from semi and unstructured data
 - gets smarter with every move
 - can detect patterns
 - can use them in tasks
 
 
 ## Module- 4
 
 ## Way to create Bots
 
 ### Learn how to create bots using the task editor
 
 ### Get an overview of various commands and its usage
 
 ### How to use IQ and Meta bots
 
 
 
 #### Meta Bots
 
 - Building blocks
 - App resilient
 - Extensibility
 - Maintainibility
 - Offline automation
 - Available in automation library
 - can be used in tasks
 
 - Visual recording(GUI)
 - Integration
 - can apply logic
 
 ### Meta bot designer
 
 
 2 building blocks - 
 
 - Assets
 - Logic
 ### Version Control 
 
 ### Credential Vault
 - saves sensitive data
 - encrypted using AES-256 bit
 - credentials are transmittind using TLS 1.2 during task play
 - FIPS level 1 compliance

 ### Analytics
 
 - data points needs to be tagged to go to analytics
 - SQL database
