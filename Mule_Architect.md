## Architecture 

Characterization of -
- Physical Structures
- Logical Organizations
- Dynamic behaviour

## Architect Types 
- EA
- SA
- AA

`Architecture is all about defining boundraies, constraints and behaviour. `

## Enterprise integration Challanges 

- Transformation is the new normal
- More data in more places
- Connecting internal systems
- P2P integration ( Brittle, unmanaged, expensive)
- SAAS and Shadow IT pushing the previos challange. 
- Traditional MW and SOA
- 10X the number of apps
- Differnt spped of change ( System of Records, differantiation and innovation).

```Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the
communication structures of these organizations.
-M. Conway 
```

## Architectural Approaches

- Do not implement an ESB

### Mulesoft Approach(API LED Connectivity)

- Unlocking your organization(System API's- centeal IT)

## Types of Design Patterns 

- Algorithm startegy patterns 
- Computational design patterns 
- Execution Patterns
- Inplementation startegy patterns
- Structural Design Patterns

## Integration Patterns 

– Migration
– Broadcast
– Aggregation
– Bi-directional synchronization
– Correlation

## Microservices generics
- Functional decomposition
- Domain-driven design
- Single responsibility principle
- Well-defined, explicitly published interfaces
- Each service is fully autonomous and full-stack, potentially polyglot
- Allows low coupling/high cohesion

## Intermezzo: Scaling with microservices(Scaling Monolithic Applications)
- Functional Decomposition(Y Axis)
- Cloning (X Axis- horizontal scaling)
- Data sharing (Z- Axis)

## Patterns 
- Aggregator
- Proxy
- Chained
- Branched 
- Async Messaging pattern
