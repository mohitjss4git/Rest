# Rest
This is to contain Rest notes

 ## Rest Contract 
 
 - Client Server
 - Stateless
 - Cache
 - Uniform interface
 - Layered System
 - Code on Demand (Optional)

## Planning your API

- API contract should not be developed in an AGILE way. 
- WHO is your API For ( What it should do rather than what it will do)
- What should be accessible
- List out the actions( consumer based categories - User related/messaging related rather than jumping on CRUD)
- Consistent API Contract
- API maintenance
- API versioning(in url, in custom header, in content type)
- Documentation
- Developer interaction(open like facebook Graph API or API key or OAUTH)
- Security (self or API management provider)
- Support
